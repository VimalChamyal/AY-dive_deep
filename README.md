## PMAYG | analysis of publically available (major) datasets
In this project I am trying to deep dive into the publically available datasets related to the PMAY-G scheme of GOI

More details about the objective, my analysis & findings, etc... everything has been presented by me in the report that I've added in this repository.

## Data extracted from the PMAYG website (that I've used for my analysis is as follows):
1. all_states_aawas_plus.csv
2. state_level.csv

### Please ignore bihar_state_pmayg.csv file for this project

## Code file
Code file can be found in the file named 3. PMAYG_Merged.ipynb
